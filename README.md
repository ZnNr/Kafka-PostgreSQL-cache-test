# Kafka-PostgreSQL-cache-test
A demonstration service with a simple interface displaying order data.  This task involves creating a small microservice in Go using a database and a message queue. The service will receive order data from a queue (Kafka), store it in a database (PostgreSQL), and cache it in memory for fast access.
